# ADVANCED-DIGITAL-DESIGN-ENCS3310-project
The task is to design an 8-bit Comparator for signed 2â€™s complement representation numbers, and then to write a complete code for functional verification. You should search for information about the following types of circuits: Ripple Adder/subtractor, Look-ahead Adder/subtractor, and magnitude (unsigned) comparator.
